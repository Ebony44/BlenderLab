-> head
--> front
---> first vertex = 3 point left from center, 2 point up from center
---> second vertex = 4 point left from center, 9 point up from center

--> side
--> first vertex 3 to the left, 2 to the top
--> second vertex 4 to the left, 9 to the top
---> left moving can be less, like first is 2 to the left, and second is 3 to the left...?

-> vertices count? 
hands for 12 
feet for 10


-> eye angle
from top-down, 21 to 23 degrees will be fine
